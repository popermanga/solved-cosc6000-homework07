In HW5, we have developed a class called <strong>USLength</strong> that is an abstract data type (ADT) for a length. In this HW, we modify the class.

Divide your class code  into two parts:

<strong>USLength</strong> class header file <strong>USLength.h</strong>

<strong>USLength</strong> class implementation file <strong>USLength.cpp</strong>

Determine <strong>namespace name</strong> as you like. (ex. your name, your initial…) Define your <strong>USLength</strong> class under the namespace.

Add following overloaded operators.

operator + to compute (<strong>USLength</strong> object) + (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator += to compute (<strong>USLength</strong> object) += (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator * to compute (<strong>USLength</strong> object) * (int) operator * to compute (int) * (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator / to compute (<strong>USLength</strong> object) / (int) operator *= to compute (<strong>USLength</strong> object) *= (int) operator /= to compute (<strong>USLength</strong> object) /= (int) operator &lt; to evaluate (<strong>USLength</strong> object) &lt; (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator &lt;= to evaluate (<strong>USLength</strong> object) &lt;= (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator &gt; to evaluate (<strong>USLength</strong> object) &gt; (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator &gt;= to evaluate (<strong>USLength</strong> object) &gt;= (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator == to evaluate (<strong>USLength</strong> object) == (<strong>USLength</strong> object) operator &lt;&lt; to perform (ostream object) &lt;&lt; (<strong>USLength</strong> object) Use call­by­referece for <strong><u>input ar</u>g<u>uments</u></strong> if possible.

Add “<strong>const</strong>” modifier for <strong><u>input ar</u>g<u>uments that are not modified in function bod</u>y</strong>.

Add “<strong>const</strong>” modifier to member functions that do not change member variables.

Develop <strong>main.cpp</strong> to test your <strong>USLength</strong> class. You will have <strong>three files</strong> to upload.
